This project is about controlling a noise function to generate a procedural terrain like world creator(but rather simple one). It support several feature and can be extend.

- Dynamic tessellation level on different eye distance.
- FBM noise generation and procedural mesh.
- Multi-sampling to eliminate the texture repetition.
- Simple water and skybox rendering.
- IMGUI interface



Some Textures are from : [Textures â€¢ Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/textures)
